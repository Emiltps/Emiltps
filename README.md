## About Me

I'm an MSci Physics graduate from the University of Bristol with a background in frontend development, product design, and technical communication.

Iâ€™ve developed real-world products from concept to launch, worked on digital campaigns in the tech sector, and recently built up skills in JavaScript, React, TDD, SQL, and accessibility tools. I'm especially interested in how we visualise and interact with data and how good design and clean code can make complex information more intuitive.

Currently sharpening my skills in full-stack development and looking to contribute to purposeful, well-crafted software.
